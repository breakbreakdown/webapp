# Prioritize Qualities
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) Usefulness
- Our application being a time management app will need to ensure Usefulness to its customers. We are directly trying to solve are problem so if it's not useful we will have missed the point entirely
2) Correctness
- Our application will be dealing with timing and schedules. It will be important for it to work precisely so that users can correctly allocate and track their time, which is the whole point of our app.
3) Security
- Our product will be accessing the user’s entire calendar. If we keep their information secure then it will gain the user’s trust. 
4) Portability
- Portability is key for our application. When using an app that helps you manage your time, it is important to provide continuous ongoing feedback to the users so they can quickly adjust their habits to be more efficient. Often times during the day users will not have quick and easy access to a desktop so having the ability to quickly look at their phone and receive feedback is crucial. 
5) User Efficiency
- We want our users to perform the tasks in a fast fashion, because users often get frustrated if they are unable to perform their tasks with a small amount of strokes or steps. This is why we would prefer for this platform to be more efficient rather than reliable. 
6) Reliability
- It is important for our app to be constantly available because it is a time planner that will be used and viewed everyday, multiple times throughout the day.
7) Learnability
- Learnability is important but not as important as those above. It's going to be a very simple application and concept to use. All the users will really need to learn is to input their events. Therefore, we don't need to prioritize making every aspect of our application easy to learn.	
8) Maintainability	
- We want to make sure that the software can be fixed quickly and easily. As a small team on a tight schedule, it is unlikely that we will be able to do user testing for every possible situation, so we will be reliant on bug reports to identify potential problems. This means that we will need to make changes and apply the quickly, easily, and frequently. 
9) Robustness
- We intend for this program to be web-based, so it’ll be easy to adjust in different environments with today’s platforms. Our users will most likely use the web version of this platform. Robustness is more important than interoperability, since there will not be many conventions in this program.
10) Accessibility
- Currently our application is turning events into a visual form as our main solution. We aren't planning for this project for the class to be able to cater towards blind people since it would require an entirely different solution to the problem than we have.
11) Performance 
- Our application isn't going to be very intensive in the first place. It's not an application that's going to need to be 100% optimized. As long as it's not terribly coded to use all the computer's resources it will be fine.
12) Interoperability
- Since we are making a web app, we don’t have to worry about interoperability because we won’t be implementing anything cross-platform. Our web app will be responsive to mobile screens rather than developing a mobile app.
13) Verifiability
- To verify if our app works is easy as opening a web browser to see if the application opens.
14) Reusability
- This application is going to be a standalone application. It doesn't need to be reused by other softwares as users will be just using our website to fix their time management problem.
